# This is an example of a CODEOWNERS file
# lines starting with a `#` will be ignored.

# app/ @commented-rule

# We can specify a default match using wildcards:
*.yml @default-codeowner

# We can also specify "multiple tab or space" separated codeowners:
*.yml @multiple @code @owners

# Files with a `#` can still be accessed by escaping the pound sign
\#file_with_pound.rb @owner-file-with-pound

# Group names can be used to match groups and nested groups to specify
# them as owners for a file
README @group/with-nested/subgroup

# Ending a path in a `/` will specify the Code Owners for every file
# nested in that directory, on any level
/configs/ @all-configs

# Ending a path in `/*` will specify Code Owners for every file in
# that directory, but not nested deeper. This will match
# `docs/index.md` but not `docs/projects/index.md`
/docs/* @root-docs

# This will make a `lib` directory nested anywhere in the repository match
lib/ @lib-owner

# Nested Wildcards is also supported
widgets/**/Sources/ @widgets-owner

# If the path contains spaces, escape them like this:
path\ with\ spaces/ @space-owner

# Code Owners section:

[Database]
model/db/   @gl-database
